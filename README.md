# DSCI510 Final Project
## Project Goals:
In this project, I want to be able to see if there is a relationship between the median income in a neighborhood (quantified by zip code) and the amount of electric vehicle charging locations and vegan restaurants. Hopefully I will be able to see a distinct pattern in this data, and it would be ideal if I could extend this project to different parts of the country to see how this trend holds up in, for example, the Midwest. It would also be very interesting to see how the introduction of electric vehicle charging stations and vegan/vegetarian restaurants affects a community, and if I could possibly quantify gentrification of a neighborhood using these things as metrics. Personally, I grew up in Orange County, CA, I drive a hybrid, and Iâ€™m a vegan, so I know these things are all correlated but would love to be able to explore the actual data on this topic.

## Data Sources:
1. Open Charge Map API
API: https://api.openchargemap.io/v3/ 
Documentation: https://openchargemap.org/site/develop/api 
This is a global public registry of electric vehicle charging locations. You can make an API call using location information and the API will return charging location information in JSON format.

2. California Zip Codes (Website)
URL: https://www.zip-codes.com
This website lists all of the zipcodes in California and relevant information about the zipcodes. You can scrape the list of zipcodes from the site and get the href for each zip code, which links to more information about the zip code.

3. Median Household Income (Website)
URL: https://www.incomebyzipcode.com/ 
This website has information on median income by zip code for the US. You can search the URL as https://www.incomebyzipcode.com/{state}/{zipcode} and will get a webpage with different income statistics that you can then scrape for median income and store in a database.
